    </h3>
    
     
    <div class="post-body">
    
      <p>After our encounter with the police we decided to do it slow taking into account that each trip could be delayed by an hour due to police checks. We went south, visited Maceio in the rain, slept in Penedo, a very nice river city. Next we continued our quest to Salvador via Laranjerias and some nameless town (we forgot). Finally we arrived in Salvador. It´s the capital of Bahia, the black state of brasil. It is very much like Lisbon, except everyone is black and the spirit of the town is much more african. It is a beautiful city, but one gets crazy by all the people who try to sell you stuff, recieve money from you, take money from you or plain rob you. We decided that although it is a nice city, we prefered the quietness of Chapada de Diamantines, besides the town is much more enjoyable if you speak portuguese, so is entire Brasil.<br />Chapada de Diamantines is a nature reseve inland in Bahia and is located at a spot where diamonts have been / are found. The place to stay is Lençois which is really nice, a bit touristic but since the only thing to do there is hiking the typical tourist is a bit nicer than the general tourist. Besides the road towards Lençois is very difficult and dangerous - they speak about car robberies along the route - that not that many fancy a trip to there.<br />We spend a couple of days there, took 2 daytrips to some waterfalls, slidees and pools and one 3 day hike into the mountains. The nature is amazingly clean, the three day hikes are only possible with a guide, and they pick up everything. They forced us to swim in the pools of the stream we drink of. So if we never get back it was probably not as healthy as they suggested. It is a strange experience altogether, we felt like we were back in the dark ages, bathing in your drinkwater - or drinking your bath water.<br />After that we drove in two days back to porto de galinhas, we will relax on the beach here and spend some days with Martijn and Jenneke and his parents up north. After that it will be time to go home again :´(<br /><br />If internet doesn´t fail us, we will put more pictures online<br /><br />Va leo (is that correct Martijn?)</p>

    </h3>
    
     
    <div class="post-body">
    
      <p>Today we rented a car to go south to Salvador and Chapadas de Diamantines. Our friend Martijn told us about highway police controls and that they like to ´earn money´. So at the first police stop we were stopped by a very impressive looking officer with a serious shotgun. He wanted to see my driver license and the car papers. I gave them and he asked for a carte de translitacao (or something like that) -  it turned out to be the translation of my driver license - I didn´t understand what he wanted, nor did I have it. I knew that my dutch driverlicense was vald for a month without the translation or a brasilian driver license. <br />The officer, who was actually not really tall invited me to sit on a table and three other equally impressive officers talked to my in portuguese. Even though I could understand a bit of their conversation I veigned utter ignorance on their purpose. A friendly brasilian who spoke english tried to translate but the moment he saw the police were trying to get money from me he quickly left.<br />The amount of money went from 3 euro for the translation to a fine of 100 euro, which I myself had to recalculate into brasilian reals for them. I was not allowed to drive and had to call someone to pick me up etc. Not entirely sure I called Martijn to check if I really did need the translation or not. He said no you don´t, smile a lot and be friendly.<br />So I went back to the officers politely tolled them that I was in my right and weighted for the things to come. They walked a bit in circles around me, prefering me to sit, since otherwise they had to look up :).<br />In the end one guy took me to a seperate room, acted like he was doing me a favour, did the universal money and drinking symbol, I looked blankely at him. Apparently they decided I wasn´t worth their time (about an hour) and they let me go. <br />I love this country, the people are /so/ friendly ;)</p>

      <p>Brasil is a fabulous country. We spend a few days at the beach and discovered that .nl sucks in service. Since the tropical sun is way to bright to spend more than half an hour we always opted for the parasols. Sitting underneath a parasol people pass by offering souvenirs, food, drinks and ice cream. The politely ask and if you don't want, the move on. If they're far away and you sign them they come to you, instead of having to stand up. <br /><br />In Porte de Galinhas we had a pousada, kind of a bed'n breakfast where they had a swimming pool, hammocks and once again friendly people. We decided to be real tourists and do tourist stuffs, like a buggy ride on the beach - way cool. And a lot of swimming in the sea, watching the fish in the reef.<br /><br />The people here are very friendly and if you leave your backpacker paranoia behind you it's marvelous. In the bus they offer to take your back on their lap if you're standing. The main problem is that noone speaks english. But they are helpfull nonetheless. <br /><br />About the first few days and the house of Martijn and Jenneke. They live in a farvella, but it's a planned one. The houses used to be the same but people extend their houses when they get money. If you look from their window it looks like a quite ordinary, but tropic, village, but on street level it's much more chaotic. The water system is broken so at one place there is a constant stream of water. The elections for the local/regional(?) government are coming so everywhere you see posters and wall paintings about kandidates. Also there are trucks with something like 20 (!) large speakers on the roof playing a tape to promote a kandidate or an activity. Also the roads are dirt roads, which helps for a chaotic scene.<br /><br />We are trying to upload some pictures to home.minst.net/gallery/ so if we're lucky you'll see us there enjoying brasil :)<br /><br />steven<br /></p>

      <p>Hi all,<br /><br />I made it safe to brasil. The plane from dusseldorf to frankfurt never got time to get any speed I guess since the flight took a whopping 30 minutes. Other than that the flights were reasonable eventless. Richard almost took the wrong bag from the plane but lucky for him there was another person with a similar bag walking towards us. He didn´t notice the exchange either untill they saw each other´s bag.<br /><br />Martijn and Jenneke were there to pick us up from recife airport. After a long discussion with various taxi drivers we managed to get a taxi which didn´t state Airport with big letters. They didn´t want one, since we had to go into a shanty town, where they life, and they wanted to keep a reasonable low profile.<br />The shanty town were they life is not a real shanty town. There are brick houses, running water and electricity. The main reason why it is called a ´farvella´ by the government is because it lacks some things like decent roads. <br />The locals don´t think they´re in a farvella, the farvella´s are a few blocks away. And they are indeed shanty towns, with cardboard, plastic etc etc.<br /><br />But we will move today to the beach :) <br />Time´s running out so another time more stories.<br /><br />BTW the mobile phone works here so i might check it every now and then.<br /><br /><br /></p>

      <p>Hi all,<br /><br />4 more nights and I'm off to Brasil. Currently I'm busy setting up my digital existence while I'm in brasil. I got a seperate gmail account which I will read for sure, I got a gallery up and running <a href="http://home.minst.net/gallery/Brasil">here</a> in which I might post photo's if our digicam is not stolen by the time we want to upload them. And obviously I put yet another blog online.<br />If you don't have my gmail account ask me and I will send it to you. I hope that I will be able every now and then to read my minst and wur accounts as well.<br /><br />Steven</p>
